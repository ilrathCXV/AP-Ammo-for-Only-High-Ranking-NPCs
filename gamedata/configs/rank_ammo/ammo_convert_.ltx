; ap_floor - if an NPC's rank is higher than this, swap to AP (used for FMJ and certain HP ammo)
; ap_sec - what AP ammo to swap the FMJ ammo to

; fmj_ceil - if an NPC's rank is lower than this, swap to FMJ (used for AP, HP untouched)
; fmj_sec - what FMJ ammo to swap the AP ammo to

; the value of 0 for ap_floor and fmj_ceil will tell the script to ignore the stats
; respective stats don't have to match rank values - some enemies are okay using FMJ just a bit longer if they already have it
